# datastar-playground

Sample project for playing around and learning
[datastar](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar) and
[gostar](https://github.com/delaneyj/gostar).

The goal of this project is to primarily get more experienced with these two libraries, but the application itself will
be used for planning and tracking personal goals in the game
[Old School RuneScape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/).

I think this will be a good test of the capabilities of the frameworks since I intend to implement a few features that
may be common in regular web applications:
 - [ ] Integration with third party APIs
 - [ ] User profiles and sessions
 - [ ] Graph-based editor for structuring goal trees. (This one might not be common but hopefully will be a good test for extending the frameworks.)
